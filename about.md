### Academics

First year M.Sc. in astrophysics at McGill University, co-supervised by Dr. Daryl Haggard and Dr. Tracy Webb. My research is focused on studying black holes lying at the centers of brighest cluster galaxies (BCGs). These BCGs are identified through the SpARCS survey and their spectra have been measured by the OzDES collaboration. I am also involved with the Women in Physics group at McGill University.
